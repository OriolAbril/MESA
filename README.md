# MESA utilities
Python scripts to analyze data from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics using existing libraries to import data.

These codes are developed as a tool for my end of degree thesis, and they use already existing libraries to import and plot data 
from MESA results:
- [mesaPlot](https://github.com/rjfarmer/mesaplot)
- [NuGridPy](https://github.com/NuGrid/NuGridPy)
- [mesa_reader](https://github.com/wmwolf/py_mesa_reader) (This library is not used anymore)

Therefore, each script require to have at least one of them installed.
